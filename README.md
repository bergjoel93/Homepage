## Stuff to put in about me

I love creating websites with crisp and clean designs. A good website has extremely easy user-ability. I like to focus on the absolutely necessary things the user should be in control over, and then I am passionate about finding the best and easiest ways for the user to have control. When I design a website I am always keeping the user in-mind. A website should be an experience. A pleasant experience has little hang-ups, and allows the user the control they need for the purpose they have. Solving these types of problems is fun for me.

would it be easier to just render 3 cards at a time and cycle through them?
